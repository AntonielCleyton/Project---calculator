# Project-calculator

This Python project is a command-line calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It prompts the user to choose an operation, input the required numbers, and displays the result. The program includes error handling for division by zero and provides an option to continue or exit after each calculation. Additionally, it utilizes the os module to clear the console screen for a better user experience.
